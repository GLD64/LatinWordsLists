These files contain lists of alphabetically sorted Latin Words as found in Latin Missals, such as :
(a, Ægypto, Dóminus, hebræórum, incrédulis, Jesum, Míchaël, obtúlerat, œcumenicórum, quinquagésimum, spectáculis, zyma).
The lists include a handful of non-Latin words such as (Kyrie, eléison, Abba) and maybe others.
Some proper names may be capitalized.
Note that the words do not have the accent mark on the "æ" and "œ" ligature and the letter "y", as may be the case in some Latin books.
Some words may have a diaeresis, two dots, such as (Míchaël), but there are no words with macrons or breves such as (āctum) or (Michaĕl).
I extracted about 20000 words from a 1934 French/Latin daily Missal, and another 14000 words from a 1952 Latin Breviary. 
Keep in mind some books have different spellings, such as (cælo vs cœlo) and (fœcúnda vs fecúnda), etc., and these lists may have one or both forms.
Finally, I suspect very few errors but offer no guarantee on accuracy.
